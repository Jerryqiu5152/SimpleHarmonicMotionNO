Our deep model is designed to predict the position of an oscillating spring across a time interval of 10 seconds. Imagine a spring with some mass attached to it is stretched and released. The spring will oscillate back and forth. The model will predict the motion of the oscillating spring and plot its prediction on a position vs. time graph.
